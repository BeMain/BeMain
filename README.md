# Hi, I'm Benjamin ðŸ‘‹

I'm an ambitious and forward-thinking engineering student with a passion for technology, music, and coding. 

I believe that technology should be both powerful and delightful. My passion lies in crafting software that not only solves real-world problems but also provides an intuitive and enjoyable user experience. I'm driven by the challenge of seamlessly blending cutting-edge technology with elegant design principles to create apps that are not just functional, but truly inspiring.

## About me

My interests span various areas including:

- **Coding:** I'm proficient in multiple languages including Flutter, Python and TypeScript.
- **Mobile App Development:** I developed and actively maintain a feature-rich mobile app called [Musician's Toolbox](https://bemain.github.io/musbx), available on both [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.agardh.musbx) and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/musicians-toolbox/id1670009655). This app caters to musicians by providing a comprehensive toolkit for practicing and learning music.
- **Music:** I'm a skilled musician playing both trumpet and guitar. I have experience as a conductor and arranger of music.
- **Leadership & Teaching:** I have experience leading youth groups, teaching programming, and organizing events.
- **Mathematics:** I have a strong foundation in mathematics, gained through studies at Chalmers University of Technology.
